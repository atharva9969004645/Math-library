This is the ReadMe file for the math library.
I have writen a program which has the functions of the maths library.
You can compute various trignometric functions like sine,cos,tan.etc using this program.
There are some funtions other than the trignometric functions as well.
Please follow the following instructions to get the correct results.
In the power function
	enter integer exponent terms.
	the base might be anything.
In the sineinverse and the cosinverse functions
	if the entries are not between -1 and 1 then the returned value of the function is zero.
For the logarithmic functions
	enter the values greater than 1.
The myfloor function gives the greatest integer lower than the input.
The myceil function gives the lowest integer greater than the input.
